The tail of Epidexipteryx also bore unusual vertebrae towards the tip which resembled the feather-anchoring pygostyle of modern birds and some oviraptorosaurs . Epidexipteryx also preserved a covering of simpler body feathers , composed of parallel barbs as in more primitive feathered dinosaurs . However , unlike in modern-style rectrices ( tail feathers ) , the vanes were not branched into individual filaments but made up of a single ribbon-like sheet . It has been reported to be a maniraptoran dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic or Upper Jurassic age Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia , China ( about 160 or 168 mya ) . Epidexipteryx ( `` display feather '' ) is a genus of small paravian dinosaur , known from one fossil specimen in the collection of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing . Medicine recognizes that altitudes above 1,500 metres ( 4,900 ft ) start to affect humans , and there is no record of humans living at extreme altitudes above 5,500-6 ,000 metres ( 18,000-19 ,700 ft ) for more than two years . There are several types of aviation altitude : These types of altitude can be explained more simply as various ways of measuring the altitude : The Earth 's atmosphere is divided into several altitude regions : Regions on the Earth 's surface ( or in its atmosphere ) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude . Aviation altitude is measured using either Mean Sea Level ( MSL ) or local ground level ( Above Ground Level , or AGL ) as the reference datum . She performed in the same production at the Royal Opera House , Covent Garden , in 1962 . Bradamante , again searching for her lover , arrives on Alcina 's island with Ruggiero 's former tutor , Melisso . It is at this point that the audience realizes that Alcina genuinely loves Ruggiero ; from now until the end of the opera , she is depicted sympathetically . Bradamante and Ruggiero decide that they need to destroy the source of Alcina 's magic , usually represented as an urn . The Festival was founded in 1948 by the composer Benjamin Britten , the singer Peter Pears and the librettist Eric Crozier . The original intention was to provide a home for their opera company , the English Opera Group , but the vision was soon widened to include readings of poetry , literature , drama , lectures and exhibitions of art . The laws of thermodynamics state that absolute zero can not be reached using only thermodynamic means . The zero point of any thermodynamic temperature scale , such as Kelvin or Rankine , is set at absolute zero . The Academy Award for Best Picture is one of the Academy Awards of Merit presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) to artists working in the motion picture industry . The 2007 enlargement of the European Union saw Bulgaria and Romania join the European Union ( EU ) on 1 January 2007 . Romania was the first country of post-communist Europe to have official relations with the European Community . Romania signed its Europe Agreement in 1993 , and submitted its official application for membership in the EU in 1995 , the third of the post-communist European countries to do so after Hungary and Poland . Tallari had an outstanding season in Manchester , finishing as the EIHL 's second highest goal scorer , managing 55 goals and 38 assists in 59 games . For example , A0 denotes the hottest stars in the A class and A9 denotes the coolest ones . Notes : The spectral classes O through Y are subdivided by Arabic numerals ( 0-9 ) , which can be further divided into half-subtypes . Main-sequence stars vary in surface temperature from approximately 2,000 to 50,000 K , whereas more-evolved stars can have temperatures above 100,000 K. Physically , the classes indicate the temperature of the star 's atmosphere and are normally listed from hottest to coldest , as is done in the following table . While some users can use them to circumvent censorship or filters , they have been used far too many times by far too many blocked vandals for Wikipedians to assume good faith on their part . In May 1997 he was appointed to the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria , and in October 1998 to the Court of Appeal of that Court . He was elected the 20th Chancellor of the University of Melbourne in January 2009 , serving in that office until he resigned to take up the office of Governor of Victoria . On 21 February 2011 , it was announced that he would become the 28th Governor of Victoria . Chernov was appointed Queen 's Counsel in and for the State of Victoria in 1980 .

The bean was first unearthed at Awazu-kotei Ruin of Japanese mid Jōmon period in 4000BC , and later it was commonly found on many Jomon ruins in 4000BC to 2000BC in Japan . In particular , it is often boiled with sugar , resulting in red bean paste ( an ) , a very common ingredient in all of these cuisines . In Japan , rice with azuki beans ( 赤飯 ; sekihan ) is traditionally cooked for auspicious occasions . Gingerbread was brought to Europe in 992 by the Armenian monk Gregory of Nicopolis ( Gregory Makar ) ( Grégoire de Nicopolis ) . The first documented trade of gingerbread biscuits dates to the 17th century , where they were sold in monasteries , pharmacies and town square farmers ' markets . During the 2000s , Romania implemented a number of reforms to prepare for EU accession , including the consolidation of its democratic systems , the institution of the rule of law , the acknowledgement of respect for human rights , the commitment to personal freedom of expression , and the implementation of a functioning free-market economy . Acherontia atropos is the most widely-known of the three species of Death 's - head Hawk moth . It often accompanies this sound with flashing its brightly marked abdomen in a further attempt to deter its predators . Unlike the other species of Acherontia , it only attacks colonies of the well-known Western honey bee , Apis mellifera . It is able to move about in hives unmolested because it mimics the scent of the bees . Today , GD 165B is recognized as the prototype of a class of objects now called `` L dwarfs '' . Most failed to live up to their candidacy , however , because the absence of lithium showed them to be stellar objects . Their strongest emissions are in the infrared ( IR ) spectrum , and ground-based IR detectors were too imprecise at that time to readily identify any brown dwarfs . However , such objects were hard to find because they emit almost no visible light . Nature highlighted `` Brown dwarfs discovered , official '' in the front page of that issue . In theory , a brown dwarf below 65 Jupiter masses is unable to burn lithium by thermonuclear fusion at any time during its evolution . Advaita ( literally , non-duality ) is a system of thought where `` Advaita '' refers to the identity of the Self ( Atman ) and the Whole ( Brahman ) . When Maya is removed , there exists ultimately no difference between the Jiva and Brahman ( Isvara ) . Mahavakya , or `` the great sentences '' , state the unity of Brahman and Atman . According to Adi Shankara , God , the Supreme Cosmic Spirit or Brahman is the One , the whole and the only reality ( Paramarthika Satyam ) .

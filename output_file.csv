the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three
friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a
provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared

already looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and
helped Gregor's sister to get the chest of drawers out with what
strength she had.  "
247,workshy,"His boss would
certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance
company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the
doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed
that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.  "
95,window,"In itself, his sister's not coming into the room
would have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been
difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still
there, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and
closed the door behind her"

of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been
incarcerated in his room.  "

must have been somebody in the flat.  "
1153,perversity,"It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the
unexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her
insist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to
crawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see,
was of no use to him at all.  "

unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not;
she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the

to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of
coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.

"
421,swang,"And more because these thoughts had made
him upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with

reply to this question, the chief clerk's firm footsteps in his
highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room.
